## Downloads
**Note**: Development versions are automatic snapshots of current development efforts. They are _not_ stable, can crash and even corrupt your save files.

## Running from source
**Note**: requirements.txt can still be used instead of poetry.

DaD uses poetry to manage virtual environments. Therefore it is required to install the dependencies and run the game from source without manual tweaking.
